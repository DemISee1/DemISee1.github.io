# Hosting an Online Website (Resume) using Etter's Modern Technical Writing Principles

## Purpose

The goal of this document is to describes the practical steps necessary to host and format a resume using github pages with related discussion around Andrew Etter's book [Modern Technical Writing](https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS).

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of hosting your resume on Github Pages as a static site. Note that this process was made with MacOS in mind. If you are using a different operating system the links provided may not be suitable for you. 

### Prerequisites

You must meet the following requirements before moving on to the instructions:

- Have some familiarity with MacOS and its UI terminology.
- Have a [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) account.
- Have [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) installed or simply use git if you are already familiar with it.
- Have a good understanding of how to write Markdown.
    - Refer to these [additional resources](#More-Resources) if needed.
- Have a markdown editor capable of rendering [GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) or use an in-browser editor. I recommend either downloading the [Pine](https://lukakerr.github.io/Pine/) markdown editor or using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) which is an in-browser editor.
- Have a resume formatted in markdown.

### Instructions

1. Create a new Github repository called `[YourUsername].github.io`.

- Using Github Desktop, create a new repository by navigating to the menu bar >> File >> Create New Repository. Name your repository `[YourUsername].github.io`.
- (Optional) You may choose to add a description for your repository.

> "Distributed version control systems \[such as\] Git... \[provide\] better performance, allow for offline work, and are superior for concurrent work on the same file," - Etter.

2. [Commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) your resume to your repository (should be in markdown already).

- Use *Show in Finder* an add your resume to the folder.
